DEEP LEARNING ANALYSIS
The purpose of this analysis is to develop a deep learning model to predict whether a charity organization's funding proposal will be successful or not. The goal is to achieve a predictive accuracy higher than 75% to provide more reliable insights for decision-making.

The target variable for the model is the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column, which indicates whether the funding proposal was successful or not.
The features for the model are all the columns in the dataset, except for the target variable ("IS_SUCCESSFUL") and the non-informative columns "EIN" and "NAME".

The neural network model was designed with two hidden layers and an output layer. The number of neurons and activation functions chosen for each layer may vary based on experimentation and optimization attempts.
The target model performance was to achieve an accuracy higher than 75%.
To increase model performance, various steps were taken, including adjusting the model architecture, modifying activation functions, scaling the data using StandardScaler, and experimenting with different preprocessing techniques.

The deep learning model, as currently configured, achieved an accuracy of approximately 73.1% on the test data. This indicates that the model can correctly predict whether a loan will be successful or not in about 73.1% of cases. The loss on the test data was approximately 0.557, which is a measure of how well the model performed on the test data.
